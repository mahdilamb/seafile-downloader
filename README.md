# temporary-python-project

This is the placeholder for the temporary python project template. Please run, the following to initialize:

```shell
python3 init.py name-of-package
```

Alternative, run (this uses the current directory name as the name of the package.):

```shell
python3 init.py
```



This will:

* Update the temporary variable `temporary-python-project` to the project name
* Move everything in `src` to the normalized `name-of-package`
* Speed up starting a project!
